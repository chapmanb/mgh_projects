	abstract = {Next-generation {DNA} sequencing {(NGS)} projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by {NGS--the} 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit {(GATK),} a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation {DNA} sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of {MapReduce.} The {GATK} provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the {GATK} framework for correctness, stability, and {CPU} and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the {GATK} by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism {(SNP)} calling. We conclude that the {GATK} programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust {NGS} tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Moreover, each computer language has relative strong points, making some languages better suited than others for a given task to be implemented. The Bioconductor project, based on the R language, has become a reference for the numerical processing and statistical analysis of data coming from high-throughput biological assays, providing a rich selection of methods and algorithms to the research community. At the same time, Python has matured as a rich and reliable language for the agile development of prototypes or final implementations, as well as for handling large data {sets.{\textless}/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}AbstractText} {Label="RESULTS"} {NlmCategory="RESULTS"{\textgreater}The} data structures and functions from Bioconductor can be exposed to Python as a regular library. This allows a fully transparent and native use of Bioconductor from Python, without one having to know the R language and with only a small community of translators required to know both. To demonstrate this, we have implemented such Python representations for key infrastructure packages in Bioconductor, letting a Python programmer handle annotation data, microarray data, and next-generation sequencing {data.{\textless}/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}AbstractText} {Label="CONCLUSIONS"} {NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"{\textgreater}Bioconductor} is now not solely reserved to R users.

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ,} which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently.

Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is approximately 10-20x faster than {MAQ,} while achieving similar accuracy.
