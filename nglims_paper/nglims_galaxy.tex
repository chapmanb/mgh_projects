\begin{abstract}
  \paragraph*{Background:} Next generation sequencing technologies
  like Illumina, SOLiD and 454 have provided core facilities with the
  ability to produce large amounts of sequence data. Along with this
  increased output comes the challenge of managing requests and
  samples, tracking sequencing runs, and automating downstream
  analyses.
  \paragraph*{Results:} We approached these challenges by developing a
  sample submission and tracking interface on top of the web-based
  Galaxy data integration platform. On the back end, an automated
  analysis pipeline processes data as it arrives off the sequencer,
  uploading the results back into Galaxy.
  \paragraph*{Conclusions:} The resulting system demonstrates the
  utility of well run community open source analysis platforms by
  allowing small research cores to effectively process high throughput
  data and enabling research scientists to quickly assess experimental
  results.

\section*{Tables}
  \subsection*{Table 1 - Sample table title}
    Here is an example of a \emph{small} table in \LaTeX\ using  
    \verb|\tabular{...}|. This is where the description of the table 
    should go. \par \mbox{}
    \par
    \mbox{

        \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{My Table}\\ \hline

        A3 & ..  & .  \\ \hline

  \subsection*{Table 2 - Sample table title}
    Large tables are attached as separate files but should
    still be described here.

  \subsection*{Additional file 1 --- Sample additional file title}
    Additional file descriptions text (including details of how to
    view the file, if it is in a non-standard format or the file extension).  This might
    refer to a multi-page table or a figure.
